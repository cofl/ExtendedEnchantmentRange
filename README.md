Extended Enchantment Range alters the distance at which an enchantment table can detect bookshelves.

By default, it extended the horizontal range by an additional 2 blocks, and the vertical range by 3 blocks up and
2 blocks down.

To facilitate this, the enchantment menu now performs a bread-first search from the bookshelf toward the enchanting
table -- this may cause some lag if the values are very high!
